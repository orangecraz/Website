<br>
	<b>Purpose</b><br>
Before you continue, you should know that this website is not intended as entertainment. It is intended to allow people to learn about me.<br>
<br>
	<b>Intented career</b><br>
I wish to become a Computer software programmer. I am particularly interested in video game design. I would like to some day make my own<br> 
video game or be part of the designing process.<br>
<br>
	<b>Work Experience</b><br>
I have done many volunteer services for my church, and have taken an internship for 3 weeks with AIS. I got to stay 2 weeks longer than my 
<br>intended internship duration.<br>
<br>
	<b>Education</b><br>
<ol><li>I was homeschooled in elementary</li>
<li>I went to Pathway School of Discovery in middle school</li>
<li>I am currently in Dayton Regional STEM School for my highschool year. I am among it's first students to go there</li>
<li>I have not gone to college yet</li></ol>
<br>
	<b>Extra Unimportant Info</b><br>
<ul><li>I am a big fan of video games. I mostly like games where I can customize or make something, or where i can make something my own, such <br>
as RPG's and building games like <b>BanjoKazooie: Nuts and Bolts</b>. I do not like sport games or FPS except for certain cases.</li><br>
<li>I like to read. I can read books and understand them faster than most other people can. I like good literature, preferably one with some good <br>
laughs. I dont like big drama's. textbooks are fine because they usually contain interesting facts.</li><br>
<li>I do not like sports. I am not a big outdoorsy person (unlesss i can swing, in which case, im good). I will not play professional sports unless <br>
there is a grade involved (such as gym class).</li></br>
<li>I am very good at summarizing, but it is out of a habit. I hate writing too much, and so will write as little as possible, so I summarize.
